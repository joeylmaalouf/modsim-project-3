Introduction:
The Double Pendulum
-System: Chaotic
-Goal: To find pairs of starting angles for the first and second pendulums
that let M2 come to rest at the pivot while M1 stops in a relatively vertical
line above the pivot
-Technique: Used conservation of energy for all calculations,
including what to sweep
-Length ratio of pendulum 1 to pendulum 2: 1:1
-Mass ratio of pendulum 1 to pendulum 2: 1:1

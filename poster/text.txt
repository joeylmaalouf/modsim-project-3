Introduction:
The Double Pendulum
-System: Chaotic
-Goal: To find pairs of starting angles for the first and second pendulums
that let M2 come to rest at the pivot while M1 stops in a relatively vertical
line above the pivot
-Technique: Used conservation of energy for all calculations,
including what to sweep
-Length ratio of pendulum 1 to pendulum 2: 1:1
-Mass ratio of pendulum 1 to pendulum 2: 1:1

Abstract:
-Double pendulum system with a 1:1 mass ratio and 1:1 length ratio
-Find angle pair that allows for rest in a vertical position
-Best angle pair found was theta1 = 92.25, theta2 = 157.1455
-Falls after some time due to chaotic error buildup in math
